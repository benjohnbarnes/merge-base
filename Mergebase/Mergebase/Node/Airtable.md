# Airtable

Airtable have [example projects](https://airtable.com/universe)

Two of the examplles I browsed seem to be very flat databases – a few wide tables, which made me wonder if Airtable nudges users in this direction, and whether this is appropriate (I'd guess that it often isn't). 

* [Insomniac](https://airtable.com/universe/expzCCzb2b2Q8RI48/insomniac-events-staffing-template)
* [Sandwich video](https://airtable.com/universe/exp7URG8Y71wUM664/sandwich-projects)

But a third example with a [write up](https://medium.com/@WeWorkUX/the-atomic-unit-of-research-insight-17d619583ba) has a deeper kind of schema – more tables, that are substantialy linked, but individually narrower.
* [UX Nuggets](https://airtable.com/universe/expShuhNMi0Oc0xpb/polaris-ux-nuggets)

It seems to me that probably designing a good database is hard. Determining the key of an entity, in particular, seem likely to be demanding of the user and of the UI they're working with.
